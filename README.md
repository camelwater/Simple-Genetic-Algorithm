# Simple-Genetic-Algorithm
slightly modified genetic algorithm to group random strings by prefixes + suffixes \
originally wrote this for something else, but performance proved to be too slow. a genetic algorithm isn't the best way to solve this string grouping problem, but it's kind of cool

A better algorithm for this problem can be found [here](https://www.github.com/camelwater/strings-grouping-algorithm)
