# String-Grouping-Optimization-Algorithms
slightly modified genetic algorithm to group random strings by prefixes and suffixes + simulated annealing algorithm as well \
originally wrote this for something else, but performance proved to be too slow. GA isn't the best way to solve this string grouping problem, but it's kind of cool. The SA approach was better, but still not optimal.

A better algorithm for this problem can be found [here](https://www.github.com/camelwater/strings-grouping-algorithm)
